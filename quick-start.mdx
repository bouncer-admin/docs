## Authentication

All calls made to the Bouncer API have to be made using HTTPS.

- sign up for a Bouncer account [here](https://app.usebouncer.com/login),
- click on the API on the left-site menu,

Bouncer API supports 2 methods of authentication:

### x-api-key in header

```bash
curl https://api.usebouncer.com/v1.1/email/verify?email=john@usebouncer.com \
  -H 'x-api-key: API-KEY'
```

### "Basic" authentication with api key as password

```bash
curl https://api.usebouncer.com/v1.1/email/verify?email=john@usebouncer.com \
  -u :API-KEY
```
