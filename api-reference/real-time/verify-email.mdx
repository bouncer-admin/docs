openapi: get /v1.1/email/verify

You can use Bouncer’s Real-time Email Verification API to check email
addresses at the moment of entry, and implement it for your sign up forms.


It is a full email verification and email validation method – it not only
checks the syntax and domain of the address but also contacts underlying
SMTP servers to check deliverability of email addresses.

Bouncer will return the best possible results that it will be able to gather
within 10 seconds (maximum 30).

This method is recommended when speed of verification is of a value as
usually this method returns 5% more “unknown” results than full
integration using Batch Email Verification API.


**Rate Limiting**

Real-Time Email Verification API is limited to 1000 requests per minute
by default. Higher limit can be configured in special cases.

**Retry After**

In cases when we may provide results after greylisting additional
parameter "retryAfter" will be added.
