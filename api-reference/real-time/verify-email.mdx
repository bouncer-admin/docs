openapi: get /v1.1/email/verify

Bouncer will return best possible results that it will be able to gather
within 10 seconds (maximum 30).


This method is recommended when speed of verification is of a value as
usually this method returns 5% more “unknown” results than full
integration using Batch Email Verification API.


**Rate Limiting**

Real-Time Email Verification API is limited to 1000 requests per minute
by default. Higher limit can be configured in special cases.

**Retry After**

In cases when we may provide results after greylisting additional
parameter "retryAfter" will be added.
