If you need to verify multiple email addresses in a batch, but you prefer
synchronous integrations you can use our Synchronous Batch Email
Verification API.

Each request adds new emails to batch processing queue, and returns response when result is known.

**Speed**

Default settings allow our customers to verify 100k email addresses per
hour, however if your use case requires higher throughput, please let us
know and we will be able to adjust your configuration.

**Rate Limiting**

The Batch Sync Email Verification API is limited to 100 requests per minute
by default.

**Batch size recommendation**

Single request can hold up to 10,000 emails.

**Special considerations**

Requests should be sent sequentially with delay between requests of 5sec
to 10min.

Results are kept up to 24h in Bouncer. After that delay email will be
verified again and credits will be charged.
