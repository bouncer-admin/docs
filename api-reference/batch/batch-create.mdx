If you need to verify multiple email addresses in a batch, you can use our
Batch Email Verification API.

Bouncer distributed infrastructure will make sure to get best possible
results and retry any verification in case one is required.

Provide array of email addresses, with names if needed (optional).

Names will be returned in the response data and can also be used to pass
your internal ID.

For example:


``` json

[
  { "email": "jane@usebouncer.com"},
  { "email": "john@usebouncer.com"}
]


```


Please make sure to store batchId as it will be necessary to check
status and get results for the request.

**Speed**

Default settings allow our customers to verify 100-200k email addresses
per hour, however if your use case requires higher throughput, please let
us know and we will be able to adjust your configuration.

**Rate Limiting**

The Batch Email Verification API is limited to creating up to 60 batches
per minute and 200 requests to other related endpoints.

**Batch size recommendation**

Single batch can process up to 100,000 emails, while recommended size
would be anything between 1000-10000 emails.

This method is recommended when the quality of verification is of a
value as it characterises the best precision of email validation and the
lowest possible amount of “unknown” results.

**Integration flow**

There are 2 ways to integrate with batch, using status endpoint or using
callback parameter.

Up to 25 batches will be processed in parallel.

_**Using Status Endpoint**_


```

title Batch Integration Flow With Status Endpoint

Client->>Bouncer: POST /v1.1/email/verify/batch

loop every 10-30s until status == 'completed'
    Client->>Bouncer: GET /v1.1/email/verify/batch/<ID>
end

Client->>Bouncer: GET
/v1.1/email/verify/batch/<ID>/download?download=all


```


_**Using Callbacks**_


```

title Batch Integration Flow With Callbacks

Client->>Bouncer: POST /v1.1/email/verify/batch?callback=<YOUR-URL>

Bouncer->>Client: POST <YOUR-URL>

Client->>Bouncer: GET
