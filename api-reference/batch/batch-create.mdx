If you need to verify multiple email addresses in a batch, you can use our
Batch Email Verification API.

Bouncer distributed infrastructure will make sure to get best possible
results and retry any verification in case one is required.

For example:


``` json

[
  { "email": "jane@usebouncer.com"},
  { "email": "john@usebouncer.com"}
]


```


Please make sure to store batchId as it will be necessary to check
status and get results for the request.

**Speed**

Default settings allow our customers to verify 100-200k email addresses
per hour, however if your use case requires higher throughput, please let
us know and we will be able to adjust your configuration.

**Rate Limiting**

The Batch Email Verification API is limited to creating up to 60 batches
per minute and 200 requests to other related endpoints.

**Batch size recommendation**

Single batch can process up to 100,000 emails, while recommended size
would be anything between 1000-10000 emails.

This method is recommended when the quality of verification is of a
value as it characterises the best precision of email validation and the
lowest possible amount of “unknown” results.

**CSV format support**

Batch can also be created using txt file, with one email per file, and then results downloaded as csv file.

Example file content

```txt
deliverable@sandbox.usebouncer.com
deliverable+2@sandbox.usebouncer.com
deliverable+3@sandbox.usebouncer.com
undeliverable@sandbox.usebouncer.com
```

```bash
curl -v https://api.usebouncer.com/v1.1/email/verify/batch\?skip-header\=false \
  --data-binary "@./test.csv" \
  -H "x-api-key: <api-key>" \
  -H 'Content-Type: text/plain'
```

**Integration flow**

There are 2 ways to integrate with batch, using status endpoint or using
callback parameter.

_**Using Status Endpoint**_


```

Client->>Bouncer: POST /v1.1/email/verify/batch

loop every 10-30s until status == 'completed'
    Client->>Bouncer: GET /v1.1/email/verify/batch/<ID>
end

Client->>Bouncer: GET
/v1.1/email/verify/batch/<ID>/download?download=all


```


_**Using Callbacks**_


```
