openapi: post /v1.1/email/verify/batch
---

This method is recommended when the quality of verification is of a
value as it characterises the best precision of email validation and the
lowest possible amount of “unknown” results.


Provide array of email addresses, with names if needed (optional).


Names will be returned in the response data and can also be used to pass
your internal ID.


For example:


``` json

[
  { "email": "jane@usebouncer.com", "name": "Jane Doe" },
  { "email": "john@usebouncer.com"}
]


```


Please make sure to store batchId as it will be necessary to check
status and get results for the request.


**Integration flow**


There are 2 ways to integrate with batch, using status endpoint or using
callback parameter.


Up to 25 batches will be processed in parallel.


_**Using Status Endpoint**_
