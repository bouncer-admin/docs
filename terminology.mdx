## Statuses
Every email address that you verify, will come back with a result that is either 'deliverable', 'undeliverable', 'risky' or 'unknown'. Below is a short explanation of what each means:

- `deliverable` - The recipient's email provider has confirmed that the email address exists, it is safe to send.
- `risky` - The email address may result in a bounce or low engagement. Risky addresses: Accept All, Full Mailbox or Disposable.
- `undeliverable` - The address is either syntactically incorrect or does not exist.
- `unknown` - We were unable to receive a response from the email provider.

## Reasons
Additionally to the status of your results, Bouncer will provide you with a reason for the results:

### risky
- `low_deliverability` - Email address appears to be deliverable, but deliverability cannot be guaranteed (in most cases it is caused by catch_all / accept_all configuration of recipientâ€™s server or full mailbox).
- `low_quality` - Email address has quality issues that may make it a risky or low-value address (in most cases it is caused by the fact that it is a disposable/temporary email).

### undeliverable
- `invalid_email` - Specified email doesn't have a valid email address syntax.
- `invalid_domain` - Domain for email does not exist or has no valid DNS records.
- `rejected_email` - Email address was rejected by the SMTP server, email address does not exist.

### unknown
- `dns_error` - We were unable to resolve DNS records or domain is misconfigured.
- `unavailable_smtp` - SMTP server was unavailable to process our request.
- `unsupported` - Email hosted by an unsupported email service provider.
- `timeout` - Verification required more time than was available.
- `unknown` - An unexpected error has occurred.

## Domain
Bouncer also provides some information about the domain of the email address:

### name
Domain of the email.

## acceptAll
Is domain configured to accept all emails?

- `yes` - Domain of the email address is configured to accept all /catch all the emails.
- `no` - Domain of the email address does not accept all emails.
- `unknown` - Bouncer was unable to check if the domain of the email address is configured to accept all / catch all the emails.

### disposable
Is domain known disposable / temporary email provider?

- `yes` - Email address is hosted by a known disposable / temporary email provider.
- `no` - Email address is not hosted by a known disposable / temporary email provider.
- `unknown` - Bouncer was unable to check if the email is a deposable / temporary email address.

### free
Is domain known free email provider?

- `yes` - Email address is hosted by a known free email provider.
- `no` - Email address is not hosted by a known free email provider.
- `unknown` - Bouncer was unable to check if the email is a free email address.

## Account
Bouncer also provides some information about the email account itself:

### role
Is the email address a role / functional one (like support, hello, etc.)?

- `yes` - Email address is associated with a function.
- `no` - Email address is not associated with a function.
- `unknown` - Bouncer was unable to check if the email address is a role / functional one.

### disabled
Is the account disabled?

- `yes` - Account is disabled.
- `no` - Account is not disabled.
- `unknown` - Bouncer was unable to check if the account is disabled.

### fullMailbox
Is the mailbox full?

- `yes` - Mailbox is full.
- `no` - Mailbox is not full.
- `unknown` - Bouncer was unable to check if the mailbox is full.

## Provider
Name of infrastructure provider which handles SMTP communication for this domain.
It can be either an email service provider or a name of an anti-spam filter provider which protects underlying infrastructure.

## DNS
- type: `MX` - domain does have MX records configured
- type: `A` - only A records were found
- `record` - dns record used for verification

## Did You Mean
If the email address you have provided seems to be undeliverable or of low quality - Bouncer may find a suggestion of a correct one and return it in the didYouMean field.

Please note it was not fully verified, so you might want to run a verification of the suggested email address.

## Score
Score represents chance for successful delivery of email. 100 means 100% chance of delivery, given sending infrastructure has good reputation.

Empty value means that it wouldn't make sense to evaluate score, for example in the case of timeout.

## Toxic
If toxicity has been checked this flag will have one of the values "yes", "no", "unknown". Meaning of which are as follows:

- yes - email or its domain has been found in one of our lists which indicate that it was involved in spam, abusing, is owned by a litigator or a complainer, or is a spam trap
- no - it has not been found on any of our email toxicity lists
- unknown - it has not been found on any of our lists, although it may be ambiguous
