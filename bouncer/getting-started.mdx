## Authentication
All calls made to the Bouncer API have to be made using HTTPS.

In order to generate your API Key go [here](https://app.usebouncer.com/signup) or:

- sign up for a Bouncer account [here](https://app.usebouncer.com/login),
- click on the API on the left-site menu,
- click Generate API Key button.

Bouncer API supports 2 methods of authentication:

### x-api-key in header

```bash bash 
curl https://api.usebouncer.com/v1.1/email/verify?email=john@usebouncer.com -H 'x-api-key: API-KEY'
```

### "Basic" authentication with api key as password

```bash bash
curl https://api.usebouncer.com/v1.1/email/verify?email=john@usebouncer.com -u :API-KEY
```

## Error Handling
The API makes use of standard HTTP errors to indicate the success or failure of a request. The 2xx series of response codes indicate a success, 4xx indicates an error from the client side, and a 5xx error indicates a server-side error. Here are the HTTP response codes the API utilises:

- 200 Success
- 400 Bad Request
- 401 Unauthorized
- 402 Payment Required
- 403 Forbidden
- 404 Not Found
- 429 Too Many Requests
- 503 Service Unavailable

Cases to handle while implementing integration:

- Status code 402 - Account does not have enough credits to handle request. Purchase is required. Other way to handle this is to configure email alerts or auto-refill available with subscription.
- Status code 429 - Request have been rate limited. Too many requests have been sent.
- Status code 503 - In some edge cases it's possible that response with status code 503 will be returned. In that case retry should solve the problem.
